Generate a **practice plan** from `$ARGUMENTS` (the topics the student wants to drill): a curated list of exercises **from the source books**, with their numbering and page, weighted by subtopic and distributed across knowledge levels. **Do not write the problem statements** — point to the real exercises in the books.

This differs from `/list-exercises` (which extracts every exercise from a file) and from `/exam-gen` (which writes original exercises): here the deliverable is a **referenced curation** so the student practices directly from the source.

Write all instructions/output structure in English (config). User-facing question text and the "what it trains" notes follow the course language (from `CLAUDE.md`, default Portuguese).

## Step 1 — Scope

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: topics/lectures to practice and the count (if given). If vague, infer from `CLAUDE.md`.

## Step 2 — Read the exercise index FIRST, then sources for gaps

1. **`Map/exercises-index.md` is the primary source.** Built by `/study-map`, it already maps every source exercise → number, page, subtopic(s), knowledge level, and a `Verificado` flag. Read it first and filter to the subtopics in scope — this is your candidate pool, with numbers and pages pre-verified.
   - If `Map/exercises-index.md` is **missing or stale** (doesn't cover the requested topics), tell the student and **suggest running `/study-map`** to build/refresh it. You may proceed by reading the book MDs directly (step 3) as a fallback.
2. Read `Map/topics-index.md` for subtopic **weights** (cross-reference density) and `Map/books-index.md`/`study-guide.md` for context. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `rules/` for scope and the topic names.
3. **Fallback / gap-filling only:** for any subtopic the index doesn't cover, list the converted books in `Livros/` (or `<books-dir>`) and **read the MD** to extract the **real exercise numbers** and **page** (e.g., N&S "Problems &lt;page&gt;" in the TOC + exercises `chapter.number`; MWG "Exercises" per chapter).
4. **NEVER invent a number or page.** Use only exercises with `Verificado = sim` in the index, or ones you verified yourself in a source MD. Index rows marked `não`, or sources not converted (J-R, ZaE as PDF), are carried through **"to confirm"** — do not fabricate.
5. Identify the **adjacent** topics (via `topics-index.md`) for the tangential question.

## Step 3 — Ask the student (AskUserQuestion)

Make **one** call (adapt options to the scope and to the available sources; present option text in the course language):

1. **Sources** — which books to pull exercises from? (multiSelect: *N&S 12e* [floor], *Jehle-Reny*, *MWG*, *ZaE*, *course problem sets*). Flag non-converted ones as "ref. via Map, to confirm".
2. **Knowledge-level distribution** —
   - *Progression* (foundations → exam level → advanced) [recommended]
   - *Exam level* (AF focus)
   - *Foundations* (drilling, direct application)
   - *Advanced* (proofs/limits, MWG/J-R)
3. **Count** — total number of exercises (or per subtopic): *10* / *20* / *30*.
4. **Subtopic weighting** —
   - *By exam relevance / `Map/` cross-reference density* [recommended]
   - *By lecture coverage*
   - *Even across subtopics*

If the content mixes mathematizable and conceptual parts, also offer an emphasis option (as in `/exam-gen`). Skip any question already answered in `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Step 4 — Weight and distribute

- **Subtopic weights:** derive from `Map/` cross-reference density (more links = more central = more exercises) or the chosen option. **Show the weights** to the student.
- **Levels:** classify each exercise as *Foundations* (definition/direct application), *Exam* (multi-step, duality, interpretation), or *Advanced* (proof/limit/extension). Use the source as a hint (N&S skews foundations/exam; MWG and J-R skew advanced) and what the exercise actually tests.
- Allocate the total count by **weight × level** per the chosen distribution (in a progression, more foundations early, tapering to advanced).

## Step 5 — Build the plan (references only)

Markdown table, grouped by subtopic (or by level), saved to `<lists-dir>/pratica-<topic>.md`:

```markdown
### <Subtopic> — weight <w>%
| Level | Source | Ch./Sec. | Exercise(s) | Page | What it trains |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Foundations | N&S 12e | Ch. 4 | 4.1, 4.2 | 132 | CD demand via UMP |
| Exam | N&S 12e | Ch. 5 | 5.6 | 168 | Slutsky + CV/EV |
| Advanced | MWG | §3.G | 3.G.4 | 96 | Slutsky matrix symmetry/neg. (to confirm) |
```

- `Exercise(s)` and `Page` are the **real** numbering and page in the source. `What it trains` is **one line** — never the problem statement.
- Include a **suggested study order** (the progression) and the **weighting rationale**.
- Use Obsidian wiki-links to `Map/` where useful. (Optional: a compilable LaTeX version if the student asks — global lmodern+cmap rule.)

## Step 5b — Mandatory ending: Consolidated Reading & Exercises

The file MUST end with three structured tables that collect ALL recommendations in machine-parseable format. These tables serve as both a study guide and as input for `/study-pack` (which extracts the pages into a single PDF).

**Table 1 — Leituras Consolidadas por Livro** (all reading sections grouped by book, sorted by page):

```markdown
## Leituras Consolidadas por Livro

### N&S 12e — Nicholson & Snyder
| Tópico | Capítulo / Seção | Páginas | Prioridade |
|--------|------------------|---------|------------|
| Utilidade esperada | Cap. 7, §Expected Utility | p. 218–226 | Fundamentos |
| State-Preference | Cap. 7, §State-Preference | p. 232–238 | Prova |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### MWG — Mas-Colell, Whinston & Green
| Tópico | Capítulo / Seção | Páginas | Prioridade |
|--------|------------------|---------|------------|
| Equilíbrio AD | §19.C | p. 691–698 | Avançado |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

Rules:
- One section per book (short names matching CLAUDE.md bibliography)
- Rows sorted by page number within each book; merge overlapping ranges
- Every row must have a **concrete page range** (`p. NNN–MMM`), not just section IDs
- Priority column matches the knowledge level: Fundamentos / Prova / Avançado
- Include the reading sections that **contain** the recommended exercises (the student needs context, not just the problem page)

**Table 2 — Exercícios Consolidados** (all exercises in one flat table, sorted by book then number):

```markdown
## Exercícios Consolidados

| # | Exercício | Livro | Página | Tópico | Nível |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 7.1 | N&S 12e | p. 239 | Utilidade esperada | Fundamentos |
| 2 | 7.4 | N&S 12e | p. 239 | Seguro | Prova |
| 3 | 19.C.1 | MWG | p. 725 | Equilíbrio AD | Avançado |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

Rules:
- Flat list, sorted by book then exercise number
- Every exercise must have the **page number** where it appears in the book
- Include ALL exercises from every subtopic section (no omissions)
- Exercises marked `(a confirmar)` stay as-is in the table

**Table 3 — Roteiro de Estudo** (study roadmap):

```markdown
## Roteiro de Estudo

| Prioridade | Tópico | Leitura | Exercícios | Tempo sugerido |
|:---:|--------|---------|------------|:---------:|
| 1 | Utilidade esperada + seguro | N&S Cap. 7 p. 218–238 | N&S 7.1, 7.4, 7.7, 7.8 | 2–3h |
| 2 | Equilíbrio AD + Radner | MWG §19.C–D p. 691–708 | MWG 19.C.1, 19.C.2, 19.D.1, 19.D.3 | 2–3h |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

These three tables make the file self-contained and consumable by `/study-pack`.

## Step 6 — Report

Show: number of exercises per subtopic and per level; sources used; any **"to confirm"** items (not verified in an MD); file saved. Suggest `/solution <source> <exercise>` to solve a specific one, `/exam-gen <topic>` for an original list, or `/study-pack <file>` to extract the recommended pages into a single PDF.

## Principles

- **References only** (number + page); **never** reproduce problem statements (they belong to the sources).
- Every reference **verified in the source MD**; anything unverifiable is marked "to confirm".
- Weight transparently (show the weights) and respect the requested level.
- Do not go beyond the course content (`CLAUDE.md`).
